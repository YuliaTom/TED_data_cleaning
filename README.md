### Project Title
TED Talks dataset cleaning

### Description
The purpose of this project is creating one-to-many relationship within the [dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UYbnDyvQkKyFp8LH66kbXSLKmXmZcEF1JaQzEsT2vVg/edit?usp=sharing). 
As there are columns that contain lists of values rather than one value it makes sense to extract them to a separate worksheet on one-to-many relationship basis.
